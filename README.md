A little script in Python to generate fractals similar to the Sierpinski carpet and Menger Sponge. The 3D fractals rotate (uncontrollably, for the time being). All parameters have to be set at the top of the script for now.

# Setup
This uses PyOpenGL which needs to be installed separately. This can be done via pip and I'll include instructions later. Once you have it, simply run it with `python <path_to_script>/sierpinski.py
